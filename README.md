# game-exporter
Game Exporter (Soon...). Blender Addon for export game assets iteratively.

## Motivation
Exporting game assets often requires iterative export. Blender has good exporters for FBX and GLTF, but some extra options are needed to improve the videogames development workflow.

## To-DO
v0.1
- Field to assign the export path
- Field to assign the export name
- Field to assign the collection to export
- In this version export only FBX.
- Overwrite the export settings, with ones more suitable for game assets. Or select an export preset.

v0.2
- Field to select the extension (FBX, GLB)
- Presets for FBX or GLB, GLTF, etc.

v0.3
- Batch export first level of child collections (automatic naming $filename+$collection+extension or $collection+extension )

v0.4
- List of actions to export (avoid using the NLA)
